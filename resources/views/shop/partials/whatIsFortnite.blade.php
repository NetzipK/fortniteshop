              Fortnite ​ is set in contemporary Earth, where the sudden appearance of a worldwide storm causes
              98% of the world’s population to disappear, and zombie-like creatures rise to attack the remainder.
              Fortnite ​ has up to four players cooperating on various missions on randomly-generated maps to
              collect resources, build fortifications around defensive objectives that are meant to help fight the
              storm and protect survivors, and construct weapons and traps to engage in combat with waves of
              these creatures that attempt to destroy the objectives. Players gain rewards through these missions
              to improve their hero characters, support teams, and arsenal of weapon and trap schematics to be
              able to take on more difficult missions.
